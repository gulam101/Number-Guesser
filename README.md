Description: An early project I did for college. This allowed me to play around with everything I learned using C#.

Goal: The goal for this project was to create a project with the knowledge I acquired when I was taught the basics to C#.

Instructions: The user has to guess a number between 1 - 10. If they guess the correct number, they win the game. If not, they must keep guessing until they have won the game.

What I learnt: When I created this game, I learnt how to store data within variables and call them within the application. I also learnt how to use the WHILE IF statement. I also learnt how to add comments using the '//' symbol.

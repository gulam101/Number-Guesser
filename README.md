# Number-Guesser

## Number Guesser C#

### Description: 

An early project I did for college. This allowed me to play around with everything I learned using C#.

### Goal:

The goal for this project was to create a project with the knowledge I acquired when I was taught the basics to C#. 

### Instructions:

The user must guess a number between 1 - 10. If they guess the correct number, they win the game. If not, they must keep guessing until they have won the game.

### What I learnt:
- Enhanced knowledge on console app
- Increased knowledge on data variables
- Learnt WHILE IF statement
- How to add comments in C#
- Further increased knowledge in Visual Studio 2017

### Constraints:

While creating this project I ran into a few problems of the application not loading up. This was because the application wouldn't close properly when finding debugging on Visual Studio. This has since been fixed in an update of VS Studio.


### Improvements:

I could improve the application by changing the colour so when the user types in the wrong number they will get a red highlight over the text and when they get the correct number it will give them a green highlight over the text instead of red. Another improvement is that the application exits when the game is completed, I could add check that would allow the user to restart the game instead of reloading the application using VS Studio. Finally, another idea is that I could give a random number at the start rather than giving it a fixed number. it so that the webpage will have space.
